##  Synopsis

Wavesolve solves energy eigenvalue/eigenfunction problems for atomic 
physics problems including calculating lowest energy states (eigenvalues) and 
appropriate coefficients for resultant exponential function (eigenvectors).

Integral for radial portion of wavefunction is calculated utilizing 
Harris, Frolov, and Smith analytic methodology in their paper (J. Chem Phys., 
Vol. 121, No. 13 Oct. 2004), generate radial integral (known as gamma function 
throughout this program) with l,m,n quantum states.

## Code Example

Workflow is as follows:

* Generate matrices representing expectation values for Hamiltonion of 
wavefunction as well as ...

## Motivation

Ultimately, these results will allow calculation of cross-section (probability of 
occurence) of various atomic physics phenomena including current study which 
motivated the creation of this code, which is involved in several experimental 
endeavors at CERN trying to find better methodologies of capturing antihydrogen ions.
